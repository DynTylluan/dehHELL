Description             : This is a dumb DEH file that will change the text
                          "Berserk!" to "Rip n tear!" when a player picks up
                          a berserk pack.
                          
                          I would have changed the text to be "Rip and tear",
                          however, in vanilla Doom, this would not be ideal,
                          as if I did that, then the text would be just "Rip
                          and tea".
                          
                          I don't really know all that much about non-vanilla
                          Doom ports, so if you want to, you can change the
                          text in the .deh file from this:
                          
                          	Berserk!Rip n tear!

                          To:
                          
                          	Berserk!Rip and tear!
                          
                          Just open the DEH file in any notepad and you
                          should be good, you can even change it to something
                          completely different and wacky that will make you
                          and your friends laugh if you like.
