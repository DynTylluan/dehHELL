Description             : dehHELL is a collection of small DeHackEd files
                          that I made, most of them being made to help
                          benefit the player in some-way.

						  All of the files in this collection should be
						  able to run in vanilla Doom without any issues
						  at all.

* Construction *

Base                    : New from scratch
Build Time              : Months, really. It doesn't really matter at the end
                          of the day as all of the DEH files took a difrent
                          amount of time to make.
Editor(s) used          : Notepad++ (version 7.9: Stand with Hong Kong) and
                          WhackEd (version 1.2.4)
Known Bugs              : Some of the files are unfair to play at times, but
                          as stated, that's kind of the point, but apart from
                          that, they should be able to run in any port.
                          
                          The only issue that I could see come up is if you
                          use one of the DEH files in coop/DM while the other
                          player(s) aren't using them.
May Not Run With        : Should run with all ports for Doom
Tested With             : Chocolate Doom
