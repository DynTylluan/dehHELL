Description             : Simple DEH file that will appear when a player
                          types IDBEHOLD, changing "inVuln, Str, Inviso, Rad,
                          Allmap, or Lite-amp" (that keep in-mind is in
                          ALL-CAPS so isn't all that helpful) to "God (v),
                          Ber (s), (i)nvis, (R)ad, m(a)p, (l)igh" - making
                          cheating more usable!
                          
                          If you want to, you should watch a video about Doom
                          cheat codes:

						  Oh, and a little tip: If the text passes you by too
                          fast for your liking, you can get it to reappear by
                          pressing the enter key (holding it down also works
                          for longer) so that you can take longer in reading
                          it.
                          
                          Hope you enjoy this file!
