Description             : This is a rather simple DeHackEd file that changes
                          the noclip cheat code in Doom from IDSPISPOPD to
                          just IDCLIP, effectually making it much easer and
                          quicker to use this cheat for the player.
                          
                          I am aware that in newer ports for Doom, it is
                          possible for a user to noclip by typing in IDCLIP
                          no matter what IWAD they are using, however, this
                          DEH file was made for more vanilla-type source
                          ports, like Chocolate Doom, its forks, and
                          DOS-based ports.
                          
                          This really didn't take all that much time to write
                          at all (in fact, this README took longer to make)
                          and it's not really all that original (that's why I
                          put the whole thing into such an open license), so
                          do what you like with this file as you will.
                          
                          One of the downsides to the mod is that now it is
                          not possible any more to noclip by using IDSPISPOPD,
                          although I doubt that the people who intend to use
                          this will mind all that much.
